    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is Josip Budisa, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at FESB. I'm eager to keep improving my skills and expanding my knowledge in the world of programming.

I'm always ready to learn, adapt, and growâ€”whether it's through hands-on project work or being part of a collaborative team. I'm especially interested in exploring both frontend and backend development, and I'm open to gaining experience in any area that helps me become a more versatile and well-rounded developer.

No matter the technology or challenge, I'm motivated to keep learning and pushing myself forward. </p>
